# School System

This project is an application to register students in a database!

## About the Project

The application allows users to register, with field validation during registration. After registration, users are directed to the Login page, which also verifies if the username and password are correct and if the user exists. 
Once logged in,users can create students that will be saved in a database with the following information: name, surname, email, age, weight, and height. Additionally, users have the ability to edit and delete these students as needed. 
In this project, I used React to structure my frontend and consume the API that I had previously created.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js e Express**: Used for developing the application's API.
- **React, Redux e Redux-Saga**: Used for frontend development and to consume the API.
- **MariaDB**: Used as the database to store user and student information.

## Features

- **User registration and login**
- **Creation, editing and deletion of students**
